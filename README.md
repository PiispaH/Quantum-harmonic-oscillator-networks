# bachelors-thesis
The coding portion of my bachelor's thesis. Basically simulates quantum mechanical harmonic oscillators and networks consisting of them.

This code is able to simulate a network consisting of a given number of quantum harmonic oscillators. Can also be used to simulate only one oscillator.
When only one oscillator is simulated, Wigner functions time evolution can be animated.
