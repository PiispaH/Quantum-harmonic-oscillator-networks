# Quantum-harmonic-oscillator-networks
The coding portion of my bachelor's thesis. Simulates quantum
mechanical harmonic oscillators and networks consisting of them.

This code is able to simulate a network consisting of a given number of
quantum harmonic oscillators. Can also be used to simulate only one
oscillator. When only one oscillator is simulated, Wigner functions time
evolution can be animated. Plots excitations and squeezing parameters as a
contour plot for networks consisting of N oscillators. For small numbers
of N, individual time evolutions of expectation values and variances can
be plotted for each oscillator.

### New in 1.0.1:
- Added new module colormap.py for custom colormaps for contourplots.
- Added docstrings to every function
- Bugfixes
